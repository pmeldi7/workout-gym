    <br/>
    <p>As you see, this article will tell what exercise machine is better: Exercise has even been proven to improve the symptoms of patients with depression. A more challenging cardio workout.</p>

    <br/>
    <p>We talked about how the elliptical bike compares with a regular bike, a treadmill, and a stationary exercise bike in this issue. They offer more exercises and a wider range of workout options. If you are performing intervals on a treadmill, you will burn more calories.</p>
