        <p>To establish a stable core, all hockey players should start with a basic core training circuit involving front planks, side planks, and glute bridges. This is because you can hurt your back doing situps, plus hockey players tend to have shortened hip flexors (from the position we play in) and situps require further.</p>

        <p>Most professional sports players utilize weights in their training, and each phase of that training has different objectives. The core is responsible for a lot of things when you&#039;re on the ice, including generating power in your shots and hits, and stabilizing you when you skate, shoot, hit, get hit, or do just about anything else.</p>
